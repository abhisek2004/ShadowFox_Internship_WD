## üìå Best Practices

- **Write clean, modular code:** Break your code into reusable components and functions.
- **Test your changes:** Ensure your code works as expected and does not break existing functionality.
- **Write descriptive commit messages:** Summarize what your commit does (e.g., `Fix: correct navbar alignment on mobile`).
- **Follow existing code style and structure:** Match the formatting, naming conventions, and folder structure already used in the project.
- **Document your code:** Add comments and update documentation as needed, especially for new features or complex logic.
- **Check for linting errors:** Run any linters or formatters configured in the project before submitting your PR.
- **Be responsive:** Address any feedback or requested changes from reviewers promptly.
